# Malaria Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project aims to detect malaria parasites in blood smear images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained to classify microscopic blood smear images into two categories: **Malaria Infected** and **Non-Malaria Infected**.

## Project Overview

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Early detection of malaria is crucial for effective treatment. In this project, we use deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to automatically identify the presence of malaria parasites in blood samples.

## Objective

- Train a CNN model to detect malaria parasites in blood smear images.
- Use a dataset of labeled microscopic images (Malaria vs. Non-Malaria).
- Achieve a high accuracy for classifying malaria-infected and non-infected blood samples.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **"Malaria Cell Image Dataset"** provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). The dataset consists of:

- 27,558 images of blood cells: 13,780 images of malaria-infected cells and 13,778 images of non-infected cells.
- Images are labeled as "parasitized" (malaria-infected) or "uninfected".
